2. **MEDIUM** [HackerRank Contacts](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/contacts/problem)  
We're going to make our own Contacts application! The application must perform two types of operations:  

1. add name, where name is a string denoting a contact name. This must store name as a new contact in the application.  
2. find partial, where partial is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the number of contacts starting with partial and print the count on a new line.  
Given n sequential add and find operations, perform each operation in order.  

**Input Format**  

The first line contains a single integer, **n**, denoting the number of operations to perform.   
Each line **i** of the **n** subsequent lines contains an operation in one of the two forms defined above.
